# DERM-2TM
Machine Learning Project for Image Cancer Detection

Objective: Classify benign and malignant skin lesion images using machine learning models.

Dataset:
6,000 cropped dermatoscopic images.
Noise (e.g., rulers, hair) reduced during preprocessing.

Key Steps:

Feature Extraction:
Used SIFT for improved feature representation.

Modeling:
Models: SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, CNN.
